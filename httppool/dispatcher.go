// of requests at the time the request is to be sent.

// Each Task may optionally return a Consumer.  If non-nil, this function is
// invoked with the request/response pair.  The Dispatcher will always cleanup
// the http.Response, regardless of whether the Consumer does anything with
// the response body.
